              <div class="col-lg-6"><p><b>My name is Phillip Makris. I was born in Walnut Creek California in 1990 and grew up in 
                  Pleasant Hill CA up until moving to Portland OR in 2018. As a child it was no secret to my family that I 
                  possessed a very large imagination, having multiple "imaginery friends" and being able to entertain myself 
                  alone for hours and hours. Although I no longer keep in touch with those long lost imaginery friends I still 
                  find ways to be creative, being that music was ultimetely my first love, I made it my mission to make music 
                  that inspired me as much as the artists I grew up idolizing.<br><br>
                  
                  Since then I've created songs spanning almost every genre I enjoy listening to, 
                  ranging from classical to heavy metal to EDM. But as much as I love making music, I found that being 
                  reliant on it financially put a lot of pressure on the creative process and took a lot of the inspiration 
                  and fun out of it. So I decided to take up a new equally creative skillset. The skillset of web development. 
                  Web development provides the same "empty platform where anything is possible" that making music does. 
                  And thats inspiring and exciting to me. I'm excited to see what the next decade of my life will bring. 
                  Hope you enjoy!</b></p></div>
